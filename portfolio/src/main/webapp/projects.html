          <p>I Choose You! is a 24-hour hackathon project that allows Pokémon 
            fans to live their childhood dreams of battling with their trading 
            cards and shouting attack commands - <a

          <h4>What is "I Choose You!"?</h4>

          <p>Inspired by the popular video game Pokémon GO, I Choose You! is an 
             immersive augmented reality mobile game that utilizes numerous technologies 
             to bring forward its unique experience. Created at nwHacks 2019, the project 
             was developed with the Unity Engine (for game engine, android packaging and 
             models/textures), Vuforia AR engine (for augmented reality and image tracking), 
             IBM Watson’s voice-to-text API (for speech recognition), and custom Stdlib 
             REST APIs (to calculate battle logic). The project won the award: “Best/Most 
             Creative Use of Standard Library,” presented by the sponsor Standard Library.
          </p>
          <h4>How it works</h4>
          <p>When the app is opened, audio is constantly being streamed to IBM Watson and
             processed, in which a call is then made to IBM Watson’s API. Given the voice 
             commands recognized to text, scripts within Unity’s engine are run and call 
             two custom REST APIs that we created and are hosted on Standard Library - one 
             API for the “attacking” player and one for the “waiting” player.” These APIs 
             allow us to calculate the battle logic based on attack types and move attack 
             damage. Once processed, Unity’s game engine is triggered to display the attack 
             animations of the respective Pokémon.
          </p>
          <p>I personally handled the integration of Vuforia’s AR engine and image targetting 
            features with Unity, programming the attack animation scripts in C#, and modeling 
            the battle animations.
